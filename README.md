## Problem

Doctors often have many factors to consider when making a radiotherapy diagnosis as they need to consider how much radiation is needed to treat the tumor, while minimizing side effects on healthy tissue and taking into account patient specific parameters.

## Potential Impact

With so many factors per patient affecting a diagnosis, it can end up being taken from a doctor’s hazy memory of old medical school lessons. The same patient may go to multiple doctors and receive a different diagnosis and treatment plan from each one. This results in inefficient healthcare. As many as 40,500 patients die in an intensive care unit in this country due to misdiagnosis every year (“Technology will replace 80% of what doctors do,” 2012). Despite the continued growth of medicine, physicians are still imperfect, even with simple ailments. They often fall prey to tradition when making a diagnosis without the data to make the best treatment plan (“Technology will replace 80% of what doctors do,” 2012).

## Problem Background

Despite the improvements and advancements in technology, radiotherapy can have many complications for patients. Since healthy skin tissue is also often exposed to radiation during radiotherapy, skin problems are common side effects of radiotherapy. In addition to skin tissue, surrounding internal organ tissue may also be damaged from prolonged exposure due to high energy radiation. When treating a tumor, physicians need to take into account the radiation exposure dosage to the tumor to treat it, but also need to take into account the exposure to healthy tissue and the possible side effects that the healthy tissue will receive. Since radiation is a risk factor for cancer, it is possible that the patient will develop a second type cancer, though this has been rare (“Side Effects of Radiation Therapy,” n.d.).
	Patient specific variables complicate this issue further. Currently, a radiation oncologist develops an individual plan for a patient. He/she begins this process with a simulation where the patient body is scanned in order for the physician to make decisions on how to apply the radiation and at what dosage (“Radiation Therapy for Cancer,” n.d.). Patient specific variables make planning the treatment more difficult and unwanted side effects are more likely as a result.
	Decision support systems (DSSs), computer-based systems that analyzes data for a business or organization to help make decisions (“What is decision support system (DSS)?,” n.d.), are increasing in popularity and are starting to be used to make complex healthcare decisions. A study found that clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) were able to produce a correct diagnosis in 91.8% of cases, beating the clinicians’ percentage of 79.6% (Moja et al., 2014). The use of these computer decision support systems shifts the decision making from a physician’s personal intuition to an optimization algorithm. The argument for CDSSs is that they will not replace physicians, but instead improve the quality of work conducted by physicians. The use of CDSSs should greatly help with radiotherapy where there are many factors and side effects to consider and optimize.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to design a user-friendly decision support system to be used by clinicians to advise them on their radiotherapy diagnosis.
